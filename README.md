NoPASARAN is an advanced network tool designed to detect, fingerprint, and locate network middleboxes in a unified framework. Written in Python, NoPASARAN uses finite state machines to describe test cases and leverages Ansible for distributing and orchestrating these tests across a network of nodes.

## Features

- Detection, fingerprinting, and location of network middleboxes.
- Utilization of finite state machines for test case description.
- Network orchestration with Ansible.
- Flexible roles for network nodes and proxies.
- Support for JSON-based scenario files for state machine configurations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or later
- Scapy
- Twisted

## Installation

You can install and use NoPASARAN either by cloning the source code from GitHub or by installing it as a Python package.

### Installing from Source Code

1. Clone the NoPASARAN repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BenIlies/NoPASARAN.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the NoPASARAN directory:

    ```bash
    cd NoPASARAN
    ```

3. Install the necessary Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Installing as a Python Package

Alternatively, you can install NoPASARAN as a Python package using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install nopasaran
    ```

## Usage

NoPASARAN can be executed in either a WORKER or PROXY role. 

### WORKER Role

In the WORKER role, NoPASARAN performs a test campaign to evaluate network middleboxes. This could be either a client machine that tests its connection path to another endpoint or a trusted machine registered in the network.

To run NoPASARAN in the WORKER role, you need to specify a JSON scenario file that indicates the test campaign the Worker has to run.

From the source code:

    ```bash
    python main.py WORKER --scenario=<path-to-json-scenario-file>
    ```

As a package:

    ```bash
    nopasaran WORKER --scenario=<path-to-json-scenario-file>
    ```

### PROXY Role

In the PROXY role, NoPASARAN does not perform any tests. It acts as a server accessible to remote Workers, enabling them to communicate when they are unreachable from the Internet, such as when blocked by a firewall.

To run NoPASARAN in the PROXY role:

From the source code:

    ```bash
    python main.py PROXY
    ```

As a package:

    ```bash
    nopasaran PROXY
    ```

### Additional Options

You can further customize the behavior of NoPASARAN with the following options:

- `--debug` : Enable debug logging.
- `--log=<path-to-log-file>` : Specify the path to the log file (default is "conf.log").
- `--log-level=<log-level>` : Specify the log level for output. Valid choices are "info", "warning", and "error".

Replace `<path-to-json-scenario-file>` with the path to your actual JSON scenario file.

For any further assistance, use the `--help` argument with any command for additional information.

## Docker

You can also use Docker to download and run a NoPASARAN node.

1. Pull the latest node image:

    ```bash
    docker pull benilies/nopasaran:latest
    ```

2. Run the node container:

    ```bash
    docker run -it benilies/nopasaran:latest
    ```

The node container is now ready for use.
